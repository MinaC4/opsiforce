# Opsiforce Overview

> The orientation doc: what Opsiforce is, how the pieces fit, and where to read next. Start here.

Opsiforce is a self-hostable platform that embeds an AI coding assistant (powered by [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode)). A user converses with an agent inside an isolated Kubernetes pod to build an app, then promotes that app from its working environment to production-like ones. Each running unit — a **ProjectEnvironment** — gets its own pod with persistent storage; a **Project** is the shell that groups them. (The domain vocabulary is defined in [`../CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md) — it is the source of truth for terms like Project, Environment, App, and Organization.)

## How the pieces fit

                                 └── persistent workspace volume (CephFS / hostPath)
```

The backend is a **pure control plane** — it does not stream project traffic; the four Go runtime proxies do that ([Request Flows](runtime/request-flows.md)).

## The distinctive bit: OpenCode is embedded at the source level

The frontend does not iframe OpenCode — it imports OpenCode's Solid.js components (`AppBaseProviders`, `AppInterface`) directly via a custom Vite resolver that maps `@opencode-ai/*` to the vendored `frontend/opencode/` source, and renders them inline in our own SPA. This is why `frontend/opencode/` is read-only vendored source (not an npm dependency), why the `@/` alias points into OpenCode and `~/` into our code, and why integration quirks (shared QueryClient, theme forcing) need care. See the [Query Adapter](frontend/query-adapter.md) for one consequence.
